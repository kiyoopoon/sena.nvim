## Quick Tips

### Beautiful Code Screenshots

Want to share a beautiful snippet of your code? Here's a fun little trick:

1. Enter **Visual Mode** by pressing `V` while in **Normal Mode**.
2. Select the part of your code you want to capture.
3. Run the `CarbonNow` command, and voil√†~! A new browser tab will open, showing your selected code with customizable styles.
4. From there, you can tweak the design to your liking and share a gorgeous image of your code with the world!

Thanks to `https://carbon.now.sh/` and `ellisonleao/carbon-now.nvim` for making this possible ;)
