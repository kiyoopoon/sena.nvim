# sena.nvim

`sena.nvim` is my personal neovim setup for Python, Rust and Web development.
Thanks to all the amazing open source contributors of neovim and all the plugins we used for making this bloated and dumb setup possible!

## Features

## Quick Tips

### Beautiful Code Screenshots

Want to share a beautiful snippet of your code? Here's a fun little trick:

1. Enter **Visual Mode** by pressing `V` while in **Normal Mode**.
2. Select the part of your code you want to capture.
3. Run the `CarbonNow` command, and voil√†~! A new browser tab will open, showing your selected code with customizable styles.
4. From there, you can tweak the design to your liking and share a gorgeous image of your code with the world!

Thanks to `https://carbon.now.sh/` and `ellisonleao/carbon-now.nvim` for making this possible ;)

## Installation Instructions

To set up `sena.nvim`, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**:

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/kiyoopoon/sena.nvim.git ~/.config/nvim
   ```

2. **Install Packer**:

   ```bash
   git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/wbthomason/packer.nvim \
     ~/.local/share/nvim/site/pack/packer/start/packer.nvim
   ```

3. **Install Plugins**:
   Launch Neovim and execute the command:

   ```
   :PackerSync
   ```

   This will install all the necessary plugins. The configuration is organized into multiple files for better maintainability.

4. **Additional Dependencies**:
   You will need to install the following tools:

   - `black` (Python code formatter)
   - `isort` (Python import sorter)
   - `prettier` (Code formatter for various languages)

   For image support, ensure you have the Lua Magick module and the ImageMagick package installed. If you're using Arch Linux ( I use Arch BTW ), you can install these from the official repository. For other distributions, you can typically find them in your package manager or install them manually if needed.

## Arch Linux Installation Guide

To install the required tools on Arch Linux, use the following commands:

- For `prettier`:

  ```bash
  npm install -g prettier
  ```

- For `black` and `isort`:

  ```bash
  sudo pacman -S python-black python-isort
  ```

- For `imagemagick`:
  ```bash
  sudo pacman -S imagemagick
  ```
  Additionally, install LuaRocks and use it to install the `imagemagick` Lua module.
